    "content": "# Developing faust2clap\n*by Facundo Franchino*\n\n## Chapter one: faust2clap basics\n\n### What is Faust?\n\nFor those yet unfamiliar, the Faust programming language has been designed to provide audio signal processing developers an orders of magnitude/exponentially faster way to develop and deploy their digital signal processing algorithms, instruments, effects, etc. For a time where one required both a C++ expert developer and a signal processing specialist to create efficient DSP algorithms and its real-time implementations, Faust comes in to serve those familiar with the discipline of digital signal processing to save hours worth of work on tedious efficient real-time implementations and provides them an ecosystem to quickly test their DSP ideas both rapidly and intuitively.\n\nFunctional AUdio STream's workflow and ecosystem essentially consists of the programming language and its own compiler, as well as several other components for testing, benchmarks and optimisation, as well as running the resulting code on various other architectures.\n\n### What is CLAP?\n\nAs stated on the official documentation, CLAP stands for CLever Audio Plugin, and it's an interface that provides a stable Application Binary Interface, which is the means of communication between the Host and Digital Audio Workstations. Unlike VST, it's free and open-source, and also tackles several issues with the 25 year old technology in terms of simplicity, clarity and robustness.\n\n### faust2[…] tools\n\nThis is a set of scripts which utilise .dsp files as an input and thence can generate various output for several architectures and platforms. Their standard name in the ecosystem is faust2xx where xx is the target architecture.\n\n### So, what is faust2clap?\n\nAs you may have realised by now, faust2clap is a series of scripts that target the Clever Audio Plugin (CLAP) architecture. The computer code for the static compilation can be found in clap-arch.cpp. This script acts as a bridge between Faust-generated digital signal processing code and the CLAP plugin API. It implements a CLAP plugin backend by wrapping Faust's mydsp class (inherits of the virtual class dsp), which is the single c++ class faust programs are described in.\n\nThe static build process is automated by a python script \"faust2clap.py\" which generates and builds a static CLAP plugin from your .dsp source code. This means after a few seconds, you're able to open any example faust code or your own dsp ideas to be tested as a plugin in your preferred CLAP supported DAW.\n\n### Dynamic Hot-Reload Solution\n\nBut hey, this could be done even faster! I developed a second tool which dynamically generates a single plugin that can hot-reload .dsp files on the fly. This means you can test your dsp code on a generated one size fits all \"Faust Dynamic.clap\" plugin on your preferred CLAP supported DAW while you edit your faust code on a text editor. This provides a lightning-fast solution for testing and usage to be carried out in the same environment in which the final plugin will be utilised, for instance Reaper, FL Studio, etc.\n\nAnother use case is switching between different .dsp files, you may open freeverb.dsp and then jump onto smoothDelay.dsp on the same audio track without batting an eye, parameter names will update automatically and you'll be able to play with various effects on the fly.\n\n### User Interface\n\nSince a dedicated friendly JUCE GUI hasn't been developed yet, and there is no on-display preset management system to alternate between various .dsp files, this has to be done from the terminal. But I thought I'd make it temporarily more user-friendly, so I wrote an external python script that generates a dedicated UI for file loading. It can be ran with the following commands (assuming you're on the faust directory in your terminal):\n\n```\ncd architecture/clap\npython faust-hot-reload.py\n```\n\nYou should be able to see the following interface:\n\n![Faust Hot Reload UI](faust-hot-reload-ui.png)\n\n*More chapters coming soon...*"
