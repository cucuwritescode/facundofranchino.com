            <h2>What is Signal Processing?</h2>
            <p>
                Signal processing is how we represent, analyse and modify signals. These are patterns that carry
                information.

            <h2>Our Brains are Signal Processors, by Nature!</h2>

            <h3>Scenario 1: The Cocktail Party Effect</h3>
            <p>
                Imagine you are at a noisy gathering. You want to hear your friend speaking, but there's chatter all
                around. Your brain somehow filters out noise, so you can understand your friend. Your brain is
                performing signal processing, taking a complicated jumble of sound and discriminating the parts that
                don't matter at will.
            </p>

            <h3>Scenario 2: Musical Transcription</h3>
            <p>
                When we learn harmony and ear training, we are effectively learning to retrieve intricate information
                from complex signals. One could say the brain is a far more powerful signal processor for certain tasks
                than modern computers. For instance, it was a rather trivial task for a composer like Mozart to
                transcribe complex polyphonic chorale arrangements and masses on one hearing, most famously Gregorio
                Allegri's <em>Miserere</em>, while this remains largely an unresolved problem in Automatic Music
                Transcription (AMT).

            <h2>But, Where's Signal Processing in Everyday Life?</h2>
            <p>
                To process a signal is to handle it with intention. We may wish to uncover what it contains, to reduce
                what we deem irrelevant, or to reshape it for another purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clever signal processing is ubiquitous in today's world. When you Shazam a song, compress an image so it
                fits on your phone, use Radar to track a flight, add digital reverb to your guitar track from either a
                pedal or a plugin, or tune the radio, you are effectively utilising signal processing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Signals can be complex, but hidden within them are patterns and relationships which one, as a signal
                processing engineer, may exploit. Signal processing provides the mathematical tools to reveal said
                structures, to isolate what matters, and to reconstruct information in a more useful form.

            <h2>About This Series</h2>
            <p>
                This is the first blog entry from an upcoming series of articles <strong>"On The Elementary Principles
                    of Digital Signal Processing"</strong>. The project's meant for a formalisation of some of my
                thoughts on the subject, as well as a spur to divulge to whomever's interested in this fascinating
                field.
